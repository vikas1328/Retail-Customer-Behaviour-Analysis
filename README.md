# Retail-Customer-Behaviour-Analysis
Data analytics project, showcasing retail customer behaviour analysis using python, MySQL and PowerBi
**Overview:**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and data visualisation tools. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL querying across multiple database systems, dashboard development, reporting, and presentation creation. The objective of this project is to convert raw data into meaningful insights and communicate findings clearly through dashboards, reports, and presentations.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains structured data used to analyse trends, patterns, and key performance indicators relevant to the business problem.


**Tools & Technologies**
Python – Data loading, cleaning, and EDA
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib / Seaborn
SQL – Data querying and analysis
Databases: MySQL
Power BI – Interactive dashboard development
Google collab – Analysis and documentation


**Project Steps**

**1. Data Loading**
Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas
Connected to MySQL databases for querying
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Reviewed data structure, missing values and distributions
Identified trends, outliers and relationships

**2. Data Cleaning**
Addressed missing and inconsistent values
Standardised formats and column names
Prepared clean datasets for analysis

**3. SQL Analysis**
Wrote SQL queries to extract insights
Used joins, aggregations, filters, and subqueries
Executed queries on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server

**4. Dashboard Development**
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard
Visualised KPIs, trends, and comparisons

**5. Reporting & Presentation**
Summarised findings in a written report


**Dashboard**
The Power BI dashboard includes:
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
Trend analysis over time
Category and segment comparisons
Interactive filters for deeper analysis
